            <h2 class="text-justify">Rugged Circuits products are engineered with built-in protective circuits and performance enhancing features that put them a LEVEL ABOVE standard Arduino devices. We invented the "RUGGEDIZED" market for those customers that need a superior Arduino solution.Â  Our products are specifically designed to offer greater performance, last longer, and operate in demanding environments. Our circuitry has been modified to protect against ESD, reverse voltage, over/under voltage, over/under current scenarios which occur within the product environment and/or by user mistake. Our products also provide greater connectivity flexibility accepting up to 30 VDC, and operating flexibility with models operating down to -40C. Handcrafted and designed in Grand Rapids, Michigan since 2007!</h2>
